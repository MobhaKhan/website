          <p style="padding-left: 15px;">Built a GUI-based zookeeper schedule using Java and MySQL. Employed object-oriented principles, including
             inheritance and composition, for efficient scheduling logic. Implemented interfaces for shared behaviors, conducted JUnit testing, and
              designed a user-friendly GUI window. The application suggests adjustments for a functional schedule, and upon confirmation, displays 
              the finalized schedule. Additionally, it allows the generation of a text file for printing purposes. This project seamlessly integrates
               Java and MySQL for a smart and efficient zoo management schedule. The code for this GUI-based app is available on

          <p style="padding-left: 34px;">The project has successfully developed a comprehensive data structures and algorithms library in Java. It organizes structures 
            into subfolders, distinguishing between linear (linked lists, stack, queue) and tree structures. Implementation options cover 
            various linked list types (SLL, DLL, CSLL, CDLL), stack, queue, binary search trees (BST), AVL trees, and vector-based heaps. 
            Graph algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra) are integrated, and thorough testing using Junit ensures reliability. The code for this cool library
